## Code Snippet 

This is a portion of my code where I was able to loop through an array of images that I created. The objective was simple: I wanted to introduce multiple pictures without having to extend to another webpage or increase the size of the current one. Although this code is part of my PostMVP, I am most proud of it because this allowed me to have a bigger visual impact on my page. 

```
let i = 0;
const slideShow = () => {
  const image = document.getElementById('slide');

  image.src = imageArr[i];
  i++;
  if (i === imageArr.length) {
    i = 0;
  }
}
```
## Change Log

I changed my API over the weekend because I felt it was too difficult to pinpoint the data I needed. The current API is perfect because it caters specifically to the area I wanted to focus on.
